# **Product Classification using Neural Networks**

## **Project Description**

This project was developed as part of the **Image Processing for Computer Vision** course at the **University of Bologna**. The goal of this project is to implement a neural network that classifies smartphone pictures of products found in grocery stores. The project is be divided into two parts: first, A neural network is implemented from scratch for image classification; then, a pretrained network provided by PyTorch is fine-tuned.
